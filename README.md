You'll need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:

Bash  
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

### **üöÄ How to Run**

1. Place the `advertising_vs_sales.csv` file in the same directory as your Python script.

Execute the script:  
Bash  
python analysis\_script.py

2. *(Assuming you've saved the code as `analysis_script.py`)*

### **üìä Methodology**

The script follows standard machine learning practices:

1. **Data Loading:** The `advertising_vs_sales.csv` data is loaded using **pandas**.  
2. **Exploration:** The first few rows and descriptive statistics are printed to the console.  
3. **Data Split:** The data is split into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets (`random_state=42`).  
4. **Model Training:** A `LinearRegression` model from **scikit-learn** is trained on the training data (X\_train,y\_train).  
5. **Prediction:** Sales are predicted on the held-out test set (X\_test).  
6. **Evaluation & Visualization:** Key metrics are printed and a plot is generated.

### **üéØ Results & Metrics**

The script outputs the following key results to the console:

#### **1\. Model Parameters**

These define the linear relationship (y=Intercept+Slope‚ãÖX).

* **Intercept**: (e.g., `Intercept: 7.032`)  
  * The predicted sales (in thousands of units) when the advertising budget is zero.  
* **Slope**: (e.g., `Slope: 0.047`)  
  * The marginal increase in sales (in thousands of units) for every $$1,000$ increase in advertising budget.

#### **2\. Performance Metrics**

These evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: (e.g., `Mean Squared Error: 2.126`)  
  * A measure of the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower is better.  
* **R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: (e.g., `R^2 Score: 0.906`)  
  * Indicates the proportion of the variance in Sales that is predictable from Advertising. Closer to 1.0 is better, suggesting a strong fit.

### **üñºÔ∏è Visualization**

The final step generates a **Matplotlib plot** titled "Linear Regression: Advertising vs Sales" which shows:

* **Blue Dots:** The actual sales data points in the test set.  
* **Red Line:** The predicted sales line generated by the linear regression model.
